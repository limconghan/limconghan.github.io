I am a Member of Research Staff at Voleon.
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at UW-Madison working with Jeff Linderoth, Jim Luedtke, and Steve Wright.
Then spent some time as a postdoc at Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, Georgia Tech ISyE, and Uber ATG.

My academic research is in the field of Mathematical Optimization.
I developed algorithms for machine learning and operations research, generally with the goal of making hard problems more tractable.
Some topics I've tackled include robustness verification, structured regression, parallel optimization, and mixed-integer nonconvex optimization.

## Other Stuff

A good chunk of my free time geeking out over films.
**In Chicago**, check out [Doc Films](http://docfilms.uchicago.edu/), [Facets
Cinematheque](http://www.facets.org/cinematheque/), [Gene Siskel Film Center](https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/), and [Music Box Theatre](https://www.musicboxtheatre.com/).
**In Madison**, the [UW Cinematheque](http://cinema.wisc.edu) has impeccable programming. Madison is also home to film theorists David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, who have [one of my favorite film blogs](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/).
**In Los Angeles**, check out _everything_. The [Academy Museum](https://www.academymuseum.org/) is not a bad place to start.
If you want **streaming sites** that offer something a little different, try [Mubi](https://mubi.com/) or [The Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/).

_last movie watched: The Birds_

I am from Singapore. We have great food there.
