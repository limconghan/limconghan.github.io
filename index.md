I am a Member of Research Staff at Voleon.
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at UW-Madison working with Jeff Linderoth, Jim Luedtke, and Steve Wright.
Then spent some time as a postdoc at Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, Georgia Tech ISyE, and Uber ATG.

My academic research was in the field of Mathematical Optimization. I developed algorithms for machine learning and operations research, generally with the goal of making hard problems more tractable.
Topics I've tackled include robustness verification, structured regression, parallel optimization, and mixed-integer nonconvex optimization.

## Other Stuff

A good chunk of my free time geeking out over films.
**In Chicago**, check out [Doc Films](http://docfilms.org/), [Facets Cinematheque](http://www.facets.org/cinematheque/), [Gene Siskel Film Center](https://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/), and [Music Box Theatre](https://www.musicboxtheatre.com/).
**In Madison**, the [UW Cinematheque](http://cinema.wisc.edu) has impeccable programming. Madison is also home to film scholars David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, who have [one of my favorite film blogs](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/).
**In Los Angeles**, check out _everything_. The [Academy Museum](https://www.academymuseum.org/) is not a bad place to start.
If you want **streaming sites** that offer something a little different, try [Mubi](https://mubi.com/) or [The Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/).

If you want to your way through the film canon, [They Shoot Pictures Don't They](https://www.theyshootpictures.com/) has ranked lists to peruse.
